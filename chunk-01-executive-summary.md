# Chunk 01: Executive Summary (Interface vs Intelligence, operators)

Natural Language Summary
- Reframe the system as two operator pipelines (External interface operators, Internal intelligence operators).
- Agents live outside both tracts; C_c translates NL → φ(g) → plan → Ψ summary.
- Formalization goal: prove/solve minimal invariants for tract separation and planning contracts.

Targets
- Goal type: proof
- Invariants: existence of valid plan mapping given a well-formed GoalSpec; measurability of Ψ from layer metrics.
