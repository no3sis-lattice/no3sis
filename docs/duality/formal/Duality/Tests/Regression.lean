/-- Regression: N value must not change -/
example : N = 100 := rfl

/-- Regression: X8 has exactly 8 fields -/
example (x : X8) : x = ⟨x.x1, x.x2, x.x3, x.x4, x.x5, x.x6, x.x7, x.x8⟩ := by
  cases x
  rfl

/-- Regression: standardWitness has expected structure -/
example : standardWitness = ⟨100, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0⟩ := rfl

/-- Regression: unitary definition unchanged -/
example (x : X8) :
  unitary x = (x.x1 + x.x2 + x.x3 + x.x4 + x.x5 + x.x6 + x.x7 + x.x8 = N) := rfl

/-- Regression: standardWitness_unitary theorem still available -/
example : unitary standardWitness := standardWitness_unitary

-- Regression: Chunk01 namespace exists and has required definitions (commented out - not yet implemented)
-- example : ∃ x : X8, unitary x ∧ Chunk01.domainConstraints x := Chunk01.exists_solution

-- Regression: Chunk62 namespace exists and has required definitions (commented out - not yet implemented)
-- example : ∃ x : X8, unitary x ∧ Chunk62.domainConstraints x := Chunk62.exists_solution

-- Regression: All chunks should prove with trivial constraints (commenting out - some have non-trivial constraints)
-- example : ∀ x, Chunk01.domainConstraints x := by intro x; trivial
-- example : ∀ x, Chunk62.domainConstraints x := by intro x; trivial

/-- Regression: Proof pattern still works -/
