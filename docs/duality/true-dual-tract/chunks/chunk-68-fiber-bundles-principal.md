# Fiber Bundles - Principal G-Bundles over Base Space

## Summary

Fiber bundles generalize vector bundles by allowing arbitrary fiber F and structure group G acting on F. A **principal G-bundle** P → B has fiber G itself, with G acting by right multiplication. Principal bundles encode symmetries, and all associated bundles E = P ×_G V are derived by replacing fibers via representation V.

In Synapse, principal bundles model:
- **Symmetry groups:** Internal/External tract transformations
- **Gauge fields:** Connections ∇ on P induce parallel transport
- **State spaces:** Associated bundles E carry operational data

The theory is maximally general—every bundle-theoretic structure flows from principal bundles and their connections.

## Mathematical Anchor

**Principal G-Bundle:**
```
P → B with right G-action P × G → P
```
Satisfying:
1. **Free action:** p·g = p ⟹ g = e
2. **Transitive on fibers:** π⁻¹(b) ≅ G as G-space
3. **Local triviality:** U ⊆ B has U × G ≅ π⁻¹(U) (G-equivariant)

**Structure Group:** G (typically Lie group: GL(n), O(n), U(n), SU(n))

**Associated Bundle Construction:**
```
E = P ×_G V = (P × V) / G
```
Where:
- V is a vector space (or manifold) with left G-action
- Quotient by diagonal action: (p·g, v) ~ (p, g·v)
- Projection: π_E: E → B via [(p,v)] ↦ π(p)

**Transition Functions:**
```
g_αβ: U_α ∩ U_β → G satisfying cocycle condition
g_αβ · g_βγ · g_γα = e on U_α ∩ U_β ∩ U_γ
```

**Connection 1-Form:**
```
ω ∈ Ω¹(P; 𝔤) (𝔤 = Lie algebra of G)
```
Satisfying:
1. **G-equivariance:** R*_g ω = Ad(g⁻¹) ω
2. **Fundamental vector fields:** ω(X#) = X for X ∈ 𝔤

**Curvature 2-Form:**
```
Ω = dω + ½[ω, ω] ∈ Ω²(P; 𝔤)
```
Horizontal: Ω(X,Y) = 0 if X or Y vertical.

## Operator/Artifact

**`bundle-constructor`** - Builds principal bundles from local trivialization data

**Inputs:**
- Base space B (typically M⁸ or submanifolds)
- Structure group G (GL(n,ℝ), U(n), Spin(8), ...)
- Open cover {U_α} of B
- Transition functions g_αβ: U_αβ → G
- Connection 1-form ω ∈ Ω¹(P; 𝔤) (optional)

**Operations:**
1. **Cocycle Verification:** Check g_αβ · g_βγ · g_γα = e on triple overlaps
2. **Total Space Construction:** Glue U_α × G via g_αβ to form P
3. **Connection Installation:** Define ω satisfying R*_g ω = Ad(g⁻¹) ω
4. **Curvature Computation:** Ω = dω + ½[ω, ω]
5. **Associated Bundle Formation:** E = P ×_G V for representation V

**Outputs:**
- Total space P with projection π: P → B
- Connection ∇ on associated bundles E
- Curvature F_∇ = ∇² ∈ Ω²(B; End(E))
- Holonomy group Hol(∇) ⊆ G

**Synapse Application:**
- **Tract Symmetries:** Internal tract has principal SO(n) bundle
- **Operational State:** Sections s ∈ Γ(E) are operations
- **Learning Dynamics:** ∇ evolves sections via parallel transport
- **Error Detection:** Curvature F_∇ measures deviation from optimal
