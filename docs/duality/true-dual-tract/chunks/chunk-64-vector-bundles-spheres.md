# Vector Bundles over Spheres - Clutching Functions

## Summary

Vector bundles E → S^n over n-spheres are completely classified by **clutching functions** (transition maps) g: S^{n-1} → GL(k, ℝ) on the equatorial sphere. The classification reduces to computing homotopy groups π_{n-1}(GL(k)), which stabilize as k → ∞, giving rise to Bott periodicity. This makes spheres the fundamental test objects for understanding bundle structure.

In the Synapse architecture, computational operations form vector bundles over 8-dimensional base spaces, with fibers carrying operational state. Clutching functions encode how operations compose across hemispheric boundaries (Internal vs External tracts).

## Mathematical Anchor

**Clutching Construction:**

Decompose S^n = D^n_+ ∪ D^n_- (upper and lower hemispheres with overlap S^{n-1}).

A vector bundle E → S^n is determined by:
```
E = E_+ ∪_g E_-
```
Where:
- `E_+ = D^n_+ × ℝ^k` (trivial bundle over upper hemisphere)
- `E_- = D^n_- × ℝ^k` (trivial bundle over lower hemisphere)
- `g: S^{n-1} → GL(k, ℝ)` (transition function on equator)

**Classification Theorem:**
```
Vect_k(S^n) ≅ π_{n-1}(GL(k, ℝ))
```
Isomorphism classes of rank-k bundles ↔ homotopy classes of clutching maps

**Stabilization:**
```
π_{n-1}(GL(k)) → π_{n-1}(GL(k+1)) → ... → π_{n-1}(GL(∞)) = π_{n-1}(O)
```
For k ≥ n, the map is an isomorphism (stable range).

**Bott's Computation:**
```
π_i(O) = {
  ℤ/2    if i ≡ 0, 1 (mod 8)
  ℤ      if i ≡ 3, 7 (mod 8)
  0      if i ≡ 2, 4, 5, 6 (mod 8)
}
```
This 8-fold periodicity is the heart of Bott[8].

## Operator/Artifact

**`clutching-function-builder`** - Constructs vector bundles from transition data

**Inputs:**
- Base space B (typically S^n or CW-complex)
- Open cover {U_α} of B with overlaps U_αβ
- Transition functions g_αβ: U_αβ → GL(k, ℝ)
- Cocycle condition: g_αβ · g_βγ · g_γα = id on U_αβγ

**Operations:**
1. **Cocycle Validation:** Verify g_αβ · g_βγ = g_αγ on triple overlaps
2. **Bundle Assembly:** Glue trivial bundles E_α = U_α × ℝ^k via g_αβ
3. **Homotopy Classification:** Compute [g] ∈ π_{n-1}(GL(k))
4. **Characteristic Classes:** Extract c_i(E) from g via Chern-Weil theory

**Outputs:**
- Total space E with projection π: E → B
- Characteristic classes c_1(E), c_2(E), ... ∈ H*(B)
- Homotopy class [g] determining isomorphism type
- Verification: E is locally trivial, fibers are ℝ^k

**Synapse Application:**
- **Operational Bundles:** Operations over 8D manifold M⁸ form bundles
- **Tract Transitions:** Clutching functions g encode Internal ↔ External flow
- **Fiber = State Space:** Each point x ∈ M⁸ has fiber E_x ≅ ℝ^k (operational state)
