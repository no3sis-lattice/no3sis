# Chunk 10: Data Flow Example 1: Simple Task

## Source:
- From: docs/duality/TRUE_DUAL_TRACT.md
- Lines: 310-383
- Dependencies: [06,08,09]

## Intent:
- Goal type: search
- Targets: 8D coordinate assignment via MiniZinc optimization

## Natural Language Summary:
<To be filled during extraction phase>

## Key Concepts:
<To be identified from source during extraction>

## Constraints (see .constraints.json):
<To be extracted by LLM in Phase 2>

## Tasks:
- [ ] Extract constraints (LLM)
- [ ] Generate MiniZinc model
- [ ] Solve MiniZinc (SAT/UNSAT/TIME)
- [ ] Generate Lean spec
- [ ] Prove in Lean (or add tactic stubs)
- [ ] Cross-check equivalence (constraints checksum)
- [ ] Document outcomes

## Outcomes:
- MiniZinc: PENDING
- Lean: PENDING
- Cross-check: PENDING
- Notes: Phase 1 stub generated
