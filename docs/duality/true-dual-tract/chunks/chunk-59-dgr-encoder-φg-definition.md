# Chunk 59: DGR Encoder Ï†(g) Definition

## Source:
- From: docs/duality/TRUE_DUAL_TRACT.md
- Lines: 675-743,1281-1381
- Dependencies: [16,28]

## Intent:
- Goal type: proof
- Targets: Formal verification of existence/correctness properties

## Natural Language Summary:
<To be filled during extraction phase>

## Key Concepts:
<To be identified from source during extraction>

## Constraints (see .constraints.json):
<To be extracted by LLM in Phase 2>

## Tasks:
- [ ] Extract constraints (LLM)
- [ ] Generate MiniZinc model
- [ ] Solve MiniZinc (SAT/UNSAT/TIME)
- [ ] Generate Lean spec
- [ ] Prove in Lean (or add tactic stubs)
- [ ] Cross-check equivalence (constraints checksum)
- [ ] Document outcomes

## Outcomes:
- MiniZinc: PENDING
- Lean: PENDING
- Cross-check: PENDING
- Notes: Phase 1 stub generated
