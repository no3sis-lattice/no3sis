# MiniZinc Generation Report

**Generated**: 2025-10-12
**Phase**: 3 (MiniZinc Generation)

---

## Summary

- **Files generated**: 62 × .mzn, 62 × .lean
- **Source**: chunk-{01..62}.constraints.json
- **Template**: templates/chunk.mzn, templates/chunk.lean
- **Renderer**: scripts/render_formalizations.py
- **Batch script**: scripts/render_all.py

---

## Generation Results

```
✅ 62/62 MiniZinc files (.mzn)
✅ 62/62 Lean4 files (.lean)
✅ 0 errors
```

---

## File Structure

Each generated .mzn file contains:
- 8D decision variables: `array[1..8] of var 0..N: x`
- Unit-sum constraint: `sum(i in 1..8)(x[i]) = N`
- Monster prime set: `P = {2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19}`
- Domain constraints: Rendered from constraints.json

## Sample Output (chunk-01.mzn)

```minizinc
% Template MiniZinc model for a chunk with 8D unit-sum manifold + Monster primes

% Parameters (templated)
int: N = 100;  % sum(x[i]) = N (discrete unitary)
set of int: P = { 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 };

% Decision variables: 8D coordinates
array[1..8] of var 0..N: x;

% Unit-sum constraint
constraint sum(i in 1..8)(x[i]) = N;

% Domain-specific constraints injected here:
% system_composed_of_operators
constraint ∀ component ∈ System : typeof(component) = Operator;
% two_tracts_exist
constraint |{T_ext, T_int}| = 2;
...
```

## Syntax Validation

**Status**: DEFERRED (minizinc not installed)

MiniZinc CLI tool not available on system. Validation will be performed when:
1. MiniZinc installed (https://www.minizinc.org/download)
2. Phase 4 (MiniZinc Solving) begins

**Manual inspection**: Files structurally correct, follow template format.

---

## Known Issues

1. **Constraint Expressions**: Some constraints contain logical symbols (∀, ∈, |, etc.) that may need translation to MiniZinc-compatible syntax before solving.
   - Example: `∀ component ∈ System` → needs MiniZinc quantifier syntax
   - Example: `|{T_ext, T_int}| = 2` → needs set cardinality syntax

2. **Recommendation**: Before Phase 4 (solving), review and translate constraint expressions to valid MiniZinc operators.

---

## Next Steps

**Phase 4: MiniZinc Solving**
1. Install MiniZinc solver
2. Run syntax validation: `minizinc --check-only chunk-NN.mzn`
3. Fix syntax errors (constraint expression translation)
4. Execute solver: `minizinc chunk-NN.mzn`
5. Capture SAT/UNSAT/TIME results

**Estimated time**: ~15min (parallel, 4 cores, 60s timeout/chunk)
