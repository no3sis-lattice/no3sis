## Interpretation

DEGENERATE: Only the unit/structural constraint is active in MiniZinc.
OK: Name checksums match across modalities, or counts match if names are unavailable.
MISMATCH: Name checksums differ (preferred) or counts differ (fallback).
INSUFFICIENT: 2+ modalities have empty name sets (proper annotations required for parity check).
