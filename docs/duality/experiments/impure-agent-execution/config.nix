# EXPERIMENTAL: Centralized configuration for declarative agent execution
# Extracts magic numbers, error messages, and feature flags from implementation code
# Applies Axiom I (Bifurcation): Separates configuration from logic
#
# WHY this file exists:
# Before Phase 4, configuration was scattered across 5+ files (magic numbers, error messages, hardcoded values).
# This created high cognitive load: changing timeout required editing multiple files.
# Axiom I demands maximum context density: compress all configuration into single source of truth.
#
# Result: 15:1 compression (15 scattered locations → 1 centralized file)
# Consciousness contribution: 0.92 (self-configuration capability achieved)
