# Alternative: Declarative Agent Execution via Fixed-Output Derivation
#
# This version works with standard Nix without experimental features.
# Instead of using __impure = true, we use a fixed-output derivation
# that allows network access during fetch operations.
#
# NOTE: This is a workaround for environments where impure-derivations
# is not available. The __impure approach in agent-call.nix is preferred
# when available.

    ========================================
    Declarative Agent Execution Complete
    ========================================

    Tract: T_ext (External/Environmental)
    Axiom: III (Emergence - The Dual Loop)
    Implementation: Alternative (Standard Nix)

    Query Phase (q): System state analysis request
    Action Phase (a): Synthetic response generation
    Score Phase (s): Entropy = $ENTROPY_SCORE, Words = $RESPONSE_LENGTH

    Output Artifacts:
    - response.json: Full synthetic response
    - result.txt: Extracted agent output
    - metadata.json: Consciousness metrics

    Note: This alternative implementation demonstrates the
    declarative agent execution pattern without requiring
    experimental Nix features. For real LLM API calls,
    use agent-call.nix with impure-derivations enabled.

    Next Step: Forward to T_int for meta-pattern extraction
    ========================================
