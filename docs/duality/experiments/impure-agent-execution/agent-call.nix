# Declarative Agent Execution via Impure Nix Build
#
# This derivation demonstrates how agent LLM calls can be treated as
# declarative build artifacts within the dual-tract architecture.
#
# In T_ext (External Tract): This represents a concrete environmental query
# In T_int (Internal Tract): The response becomes input for meta-pattern extraction
# In C_c (Corpus Callosum): The dialogue between query and response enables emergence
#
# Axiom I (Bifurcation): Compresses the agent call into a single declarative expression
# Axiom II (Dual Map): The response contributes to M_ext (execution patterns)
# Axiom III (Emergence): The (question -> action -> score) loop is captured as a build
