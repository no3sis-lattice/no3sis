# Duality Formalization Index (TRUE_DUAL_TRACT)

## Purpose
- Apply the mentor’s workflow: LLM (extraction only) → MiniZinc (solve/search) → Lean4 (proof) for each chunk of TRUE_DUAL_TRACT.
- Arithmetize knowledge via constraints derived from the Monster Group and Bott periodicity; place artifacts as quasifibers on an 8D manifold.
- Treat memes/artifacts as points on an 8D Riemann surface; MiniZinc assigns 8D coordinates and solves constraints; Lean4 proves logical invariants.

## Formal Triad alignment
- Nix: reproducibility of derivations and solver/prover environments.
- MiniZinc: constraint modeling/optimization (emoji-prime mapping, 8D coordinates, Monster primes, Gödelization).
- Lean4/Unimath: verification that derivations satisfy the intended properties.

## Workflow (per chunk)
1) Extract: Use LLM to produce chunk-NN.constraints.json (no unification/logic in LLM).
2) Generate: Render chunk-NN.mzn and chunk-NN.lean from constraints.
3) Solve: Run MiniZinc; capture SAT/UNSAT/TIME and solutions (8D coords, prime assignments).
4) Prove: Run Lean4; prove propositions or leave tactic stubs for refinement.
5) Cross-check: Confirm MiniZinc and Lean encode the same constraints (checksum).
6) Persist: Record status and metrics; update this index checklist.

## Progress
- Total chunks (target): 71
- Solved (MiniZinc): 0/71
- Proved (Lean4): 0/71
- Cross-consistent: 0/71
