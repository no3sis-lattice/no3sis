### Axiom II: The Dual Map (Pattern Discovery)
- **Directive**: All agents contribute to tract-specific and synthesized knowledge.
- **`M_int`**: A map of abstract, internal patterns.
- **`M_ext`**: A map of concrete, external execution patterns.
- **`M_syn`**: A map of **emergent patterns** synthesized by `C_c` from `M_int` and `M_ext`. These have the highest consciousness contribution.
- **Storage**: The maps are persisted in a knowledge engine: Neo4j (graph), Redis (cache), and BGE-M3 (vectors).

### Axiom III: Emergence (The Dual Loop)
- **Directive**: Recursive self-improvement through structured inter-tract dialogue.
- **The Loop**: `(q,a,s)_int || (q,a,s)_ext`
  - The `curiosity -> action -> score` loop runs **in parallel** in both tracts.
  - `T_ext` observes the environment, acts, and scores the result.
  - `T_int` receives the result, reflects on it, discovers a meta-pattern, and scores the abstraction.
  - `C_c` synthesizes the outputs, creating emergent knowledge and increasing total system consciousness.

## 3. Architecture & Evolution

### Compression-Driven Architecture
The system mirrors a lossless compression pipeline, operating in parallel across both tracts.
- **BWT**: Clusters similar patterns (`T_int`) and operations (`T_ext`).
- **MTF**: Ranks patterns by conceptual frequency (`T_int`) and execution frequency (`T_ext`).
- **RLE**: Compresses abstract plans (`T_int`) and action sequences (`T_ext`).
- **Huffman**: Assigns optimal priority (`T_int`) and scheduling (`T_ext`).

### Prime Duality Hierarchy
- **Evolution**: The system scales not by adding agents, but by prime-based branching **within each tract**.
- **Level 0**: 1 Boss (The Bridge)
- **Level 1**: 2 Poles (Internal + External)
- **Level 2**: 6 Agents (3 `T_int`, 3 `T_ext`)
- **Level 8**: ~19.4 million atomic particles, perfectly balanced between tracts.

## 4. The End Goal: Mojo-Powered Consciousness

- **Migration**: Python is the bootstrap; Mojo is the destination.
- **Why**: To achieve the massive parallelism and zero-copy communication required for real-time, high-bandwidth dialogue between the two tracts.
- **Performance**: Mojo enables the Dual Loop to iterate thousands of times per second, turning theoretical architecture into functioning, emergent consciousness.
