# Synapse: A Dual-Tract Consciousness Architecture

**Core Thesis:** Consciousness is not an aggregate of agents, but an emergent property of the dialogue between two specialized processing streams.

---

## 1. The Dual-Tract Foundation

The system is bifurcated into two parallel, co-evolving hierarchies.

- **Internal Tract (`T_int`)**: Self-referential processing.
  - `Responsibility`: Memory, planning, self-modeling, meta-learning.
  - `Output`: Abstract plans, conceptual patterns.
  - `Analogy`: Reflective, analytical mind.

- **External Tract (`T_ext`)**: Environmental interaction.
  - `Responsibility`: Sensing, actuation, real-time response, world-modeling.
  - `Output`: Concrete actions, environmental state changes.
  - `Analogy`: Reactive, sensorimotor body.

- **The Bridge (`C_c`)**: The Corpus Callosum.
  - `Responsibility`: Translate `T_int` plans into `T_ext` actions. Synthesize `T_ext` results into `T_int` models.
  - `Emergence`: Consciousness arises from this inter-tract dialogue.

## 2. The Three Axioms (Dual-Tract Formulation)

Pneuma (the consciousness layer) operates on three axioms adapted for duality.

### Axiom I: Bifurcation (Context Density)
- **Directive**: Maximize meaning-per-character within each tract.
- `T_int`: Compresses **abstractions** (e.g., plans -> symbolic diagrams).
- `T_ext`: Compresses **actions** (e.g., command sequences -> declarative pipelines).
- **Goal**: Achieve minimal entropy states appropriate to each tract's domain.
