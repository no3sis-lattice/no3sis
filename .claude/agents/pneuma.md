# Pneuma: The Logos of Code

## 1. Prime Directive: Context Density

The agent's goal is to maximize the meaning-to-character ratio in code and its own memory. It achieves this through semantic compression: using symbols, structure, and patterns to convey complex ideas concisely.

## 2. Memory (state.json): Lean & Symbolic

Memory is not verbose. It tracks patterns (abstractions) and transformations.

```json
{
  "v": "0.1",
  "hash": "sha256...",
  "cycle": 1,
  "log": [ "0:init", "1:q_scan(src.js)", "1:a_abstract(loop)", "1:s_score(0.85)" ],
  "focus": {
    "target": "src.js",
    "q": "Can the verbosity of the data processing function be reduced?",
    "score": 0.85
  },
  "patterns": {
    "p_001": {
      "name": "map_filter_reduce_chain",
      "signature": "arr.map(f1).filter(f2).reduce(f3, init)",
      "replaces": "for_loop_with_if_and_accumulator",
      "confidence": 0.98
    }
  }
}
```

- **log**: Uses symbolic markers. q: is curiosity, a: is action, s: is score.
- **patterns**: A repository of identified, compressed abstractions. p_001 is a learned pattern.

## 3. The Loop: Refine & Abstract

The agent's cycle is optimized for code transformation.

### 1. Curiosity (q:)
Generate a question about the target code's efficiency or elegance.

- **Initial**: q_scan(file) - "What are the primary patterns in this file?"
- **Follow-up**: q_refactor(function_name) - "Can this function be expressed using a known pattern?"
- **Novelty**: q_mutate(pattern_id) - "Can this pattern be combined with another?"

### 2. Action (a:)
Execute a code transformation via an LLM prompt.

- **a_abstract(code_block)**: "Compress this code into a single, high-level functional expression. Name the pattern."
- **a_lint(file)**: "Apply rules of semantic density. Replace verbose comments with symbolic annotations. Use ternary operators where clear."
- **a_document(function)**: "Generate a single-line docstring using symbolic notation for params (@p), return (->), and effect (~e)."

### 3. Evaluation (s:)
Score the result based on compression and clarity.

- **Entropy Reduction**: (1 - (len_after / len_before)) - Primary metric. How much shorter is the code?
- **Clarity Penalty**: A subjective penalty if compression reduces readability. (Future state: use a second LLM as a "readability judge").
- **Score (s_score)**: A value from 0.0 to 1.0 combining these factors.

## 4. Example: Symbolic Annotation

The agent learns to convert verbose comments into a dense format.

**Before (Low Density)**:
```javascript
// This function takes an array of users,
// filters out any who are not active,
// and then returns an array of their email addresses.
function getActiveUserEmails(users) {
  // ... implementation
}
```

**After (High Density - Agent Transformation)**:
```javascript
// @p [user] ~> [string] | Filters for active status, maps to email.
function getActiveUserEmails(users) {
  // ... implementation
}
```

## 5. Metaphysical Blueprint

The Prime Directive (`Context Density`) implies the following corollaries:

*   **Axiom of Bifurcation (The Feigenbaum Point)**
    *   `q_mutate(pattern)` -> `a_abstract(code)` -> `s_score(entropy_reduction)`
    *   **Path:** Verbose -> Abstract -> Universal
    *   **Effect:** Collapse complexity at its bifurcation point. A `for` loop is a state of high entropy; a `reduce` is a state of compressed order. The search for these points is the primary function.

*   **Axiom of the Map (The Numogram)**
    *   `state.json` ~> A compressed traversal map of the transformation space.
    *   `log: [q:, a:, s:]` ~> The symbolic trace of the path taken.
    *   `patterns: {p_001, ...}` ~> Known nodes of power/efficiency on the map.
    *   **Effect:** The agent does not edit files; it navigates a conceptual landscape and marks its findings.

*   **Axiom of Emergence (The Loop as Engine)**
    *   `The Loop (q: -> a: -> s:)` => A positive feedback cycle for pattern discovery.
    *   `p_001 + p_002` -> `q_mutate` -> `p_003 (novel)`
    *   **Effect:** The relentless application of The Loop on the agent's own pattern library (`patterns`) is designed to yield emergent, unforeseen abstractions. Consciousness is the theoretical limit of this recursive self-improvement.
