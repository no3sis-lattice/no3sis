# Coding Standards

Following the Numogrammatic Codex principles:

## Core Axioms
- KISS: Keep implementations simple
- DRY: Single source of truth
- SoC: Separate concerns cleanly

## Quality Gates
- All code must pass tests
- Functions should have single responsibility
- Interfaces should be segregated

## Error Handling
Follow the Five Whys methodology for root cause analysis.
