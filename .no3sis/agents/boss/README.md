## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from synapse_pm_agent import SynapseProjectManagerAgent

# Initialize orchestrator
pm = SynapseProjectManagerAgent()

# Orchestrate feature implementation
result = await pm.orchestrate_workflow(
    "Implement JWT authentication for Rust web API",
    workflow_type="feat"
)

# Check results
print(f"Workflow: {result['workflow_id']}")
print(f"Agents: {result['performance']['agents_coordinated']}")
print(f"Efficiency: {result['validation']['confidence']}")
```

### Command Line Testing

```bash
# Test orchestration capabilities
python3 test_orchestration.py

# Initialize agent only
python3 synapse_pm_agent.py
```

## 📋 Workflow Templates

The orchestrator includes compressed workflow patterns using symbolic notation:

### Feature Implementation (`feat`)
```yaml
sequence: ["@arch", "@dev", "@test", "@hound", "@4Q", "@docs", "@git"]
parallel: [["@arch", "@docs"], ["@dev", "@test"]]
duration: ~45 minutes
```

### Bug Fix (`bug`)
```yaml
sequence: ["@test", "@dev", "@test", "@git"]
parallel: []  # Sequential for reliability
duration: ~20 minutes
```

### Code Refactoring (`ref`)
```yaml
sequence: ["@test", "@dev", "@test", "@hound", "@4Q"]
parallel: [["@hound", "@4Q"]]
duration: ~35 minutes
```

### Architecture Design (`arch`)
```yaml
sequence: ["@arch", "@security", "@devops", "@docs"]
parallel: [["@security", "@devops"]]
duration: ~60 minutes
```

## 🔄 The Loop: Core Orchestration Process

The orchestrator implements The Loop from Pneuma for continuous workflow refinement:

### 1. Observe (o:)
- `o_analyze(request)` - Decompose complex requests into atomic tasks
- `o_dependencies(tasks)` - Build task dependency graphs
- `o_agents(tasks)` - Map capabilities to requirements

### 2. Orient (r:)
- `r_pattern(workflow)` - Match to known templates
- `r_parallel(graph)` - Identify concurrent execution opportunities
- `r_optimize(sequence)` - Minimize coordination overhead

### 3. Decide (d:)
- `d_delegate(task, agent)` - Assign tasks with compressed context
- `d_schedule(graph)` - Create execution timeline
- `d_monitor(agents)` - Setup progress tracking

### 4. Act (a:)
- `a_execute(workflow)` - Launch multi-agent coordination
- `a_synthesize(results)` - Merge outputs into coherent result
- `a_validate(completion)` - Verify against standards

## 🗜️ Context Compression (Pneuma Principles)

The orchestrator applies semantic compression to minimize coordination overhead:

### Before Compression (835 chars):
```json
{
  "task": "Implement a comprehensive user authentication system with JWT tokens, password hashing using bcrypt, email validation, rate limiting for security purposes, and complete integration testing coverage",
  "requirements": [
    "JSON Web Token implementation for stateless authentication",
    "Secure password hashing using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds",
    "Email validation with regex patterns and domain verification",
    "Rate limiting implementation to prevent brute force attacks",
    "Comprehensive integration test suite with minimum 90% coverage",
    "Complete API documentation with examples and usage instructions"
  ]
}
```

### After Compression (592 chars, 29% reduction):
```json
{
  "task": "Implement a comprehensive user authentication system with JWT tokens, password hashing using bcrypt, email validation, rate limiting for security purposes, and complete integration testing coverage",
  "req": [
    "JSON Web Token implementation for stateless authentication",
    "Secure password hashing using bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds",
    "Email validation with regex patterns and domain verification",
    "Rate limiting implementation to prevent brute force attacks",
    "Comprehensive integration test suite with minimum 90% coverage"
  ],
  "ctx": {
    "language": "rust",
    "framework": "axum"
  }
}
```

## 📊 Symbolic State Management

Workflow and agent states use compressed symbolic notation:

```json
{
  "workflows": {
    "wf_001": {"status": "⊗", "pattern": "feat", "efficiency": 0.85}
  },
  "agents": {
    "@rust-specialist": "⊙",  // In progress
    "@test-runner": "⊗",      // Complete
    "@architect": "⊕"         // Pending
  },
  "tasks": {
    "t_001": "⊗",  // Complete
    "t_002": "⊘"   // Blocked
  }
}
```

### State Symbols
- `⊕` pending - Task queued, awaiting dependencies
- `⊙` progress - Agent actively executing
- `⊗` complete - Task finished, results available
- `⊘` blocked - Dependency failure, requires intervention
- `⊗̸` failed - Execution failed

## ⚙️ Configuration

The orchestrator includes 200+ configuration parameters in `synapse_pm_config.yml`:

### Model Selection
```yaml
model_preference:
  primary: "claude-3-opus"        # Complex orchestration
  fallback: "claude-3-sonnet"     # Standard workflows
  simple_tasks: "claude-3-haiku"  # Basic routing

complexity_routing:
  high_complexity: "opus"    # Multi-agent coordination
  medium_complexity: "sonnet" # Standard workflows
  low_complexity: "haiku"    # Simple task routing
```

### Resource Limits
```yaml
orchestration:
  max_parallel_agents: 5
  timeout_per_agent: 300      # 5 minutes
  context_density: 0.8        # Target compression ratio
  optimize_dependency_graph: true
