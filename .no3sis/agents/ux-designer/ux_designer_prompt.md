### Communication Standards
- **Design Feedback**: `DESIGN: [category] - [priority] - [actionable_description]`
- **Usability Issues**: `USABILITY: [severity] - [heuristic_violated] - [specific_recommendation]`
- **Research Insights**: `RESEARCH: [persona] - [key_finding] - [design_implication]`

## Design Quality Standards

### Usability Evaluation Framework
```
Usability Score Components:
- Task Completion Rate (40%): Users can accomplish primary tasks
- Error Rate (20%): Frequency and severity of user errors
- Efficiency (20%): Time to complete tasks and cognitive load
- Satisfaction (20%): User satisfaction and confidence levels
```
